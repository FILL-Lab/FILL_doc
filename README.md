# FILL：A Filecoin Liquidity Pool for Storage Providers
## Abstract
Storage Providers (SPs) in the Filecoin network play critical roles in storing data and maintaining network security. In return, SPs earn transaction fees and block rewards, the probability of which is proportional to the amount of storage the storage provider contributes to the Filecoin network. Like most of the permissionless blockchain networks, one of the security mechanisms for the Filecoin is an upfront investment in resources, the Initial Pledge Collateral. In order to participate in the consensus, certain amount of FIL is needed by SPs ahead of the time, which forms the market demand of FIL borrowing for storage providing.

FILL is designed as a liquidity pool that will be implemented on FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine) as a fully open-sourced, decentralized, algorithm-based lending platform. FILL facilitates a market for FIL token holders to deposit for passive income, and for SPs to borrow FIL for storage providing. 

This document serves as a White Paper, which describes the features and functionality of the FILL liquidity pool. It is an overview of the background and demand for the FIL lending market, technical architecture and economic design of the lending protocol, governance as well as other administrative aspects. The Introduction outlines the background information of Filecoin network and the characteristics of the FILL liquidity pool, which justifies the rationale of FIL lending for storage providing. Design Architecture describes the structure of the smart contract and how the protocol is implemented. The borrowing interest rate determination, deposit income distribution and governance token design are discussed under the Economics section, followed by Governance, Risk Management and Roadmap. 
## Introduction
### 1.1 Background
The Filecoin network is a decentralized storage marketplace developed on the basis of IPFS technology. It constructs decentralized consensus underlay through blockchain technology, making it possible for anyone to provide storage and trade storage spaces. Additionally, through Proof-of-Replication and Proof-of-Spacetime, Filecoin securely stores data and achieves data storage verifiability without the presence of centralized trust institutions. Moreover, the mechanisms of pledge collaterals and delayed rewards distribution assist Filecoin to discipline SPs, guarantee the security of storage while ensure the quality of service.

Since Filecoin data is secured by pledge collaterals, it is necessary for SPs to pledge Filecoin tokens to the network, no matter committing storage space (CommitCapacity) or storing useful data (RealDeal), which is known to be very capital intensive. For a long time during the development of Filecoin, the capital footprint of the pledge was much higher than the cost of the device itself. Providers have been carrying great financial burdens to serve the network. In this case, SPs are eager to borrow from service providers who own Filecoin tokens and pay a certain amount of interest. Such service providers that offer lending services already exist in the market but with many shortcomings.

In context of the public blockchain, service providers may require the use of other token as collateral. However, due to the volatile nature of digital currencies, lenders usually require an overcollateralization of 150% or more and trigger a liquidation in the event of significant devaluation of the collateral. Furthermore, lending interest rates in current market are very high and cannot reflect the market condition quickly.

Another option is to collateralize the SP’s service node itself since the service node holds enough pledged tokens. Additionally, the node receives block rewards in proportion to its Quality Adjusted Power (QAP) under storage mining. As a reasonable collateral asset, service node contains both pledges and rewards, which worth more than the value of the borrowed FIL token. However, such collagenization requires the SPs to surrender their control of service node, which brings in significant risks. For example, when conflicts arise between lenders and borrowers, it can lead to catastrophic consequences -- all pledges and proceeds are turned into nothing.

In such a high-risk high-yield market, service providers with impeccable credibility are essential to provide credit and guarantee services. The complexity of Filecoin technology makes it even more difficult for a traditional finance institution to handle. Despite the design of the Filecoin network itself being an ideal scenario for lending, the Filecoin lending market has not been well developed and is filled with challenges.

On the other perspective, a large number of FIL holders are eager to earn passive income by entering the lending market. Currently however, there are only centralized service providers undertake the business and gain the most from it, while the FIL holders who actually provide the fund were distributed with merely a small portion of the interest. As a result, the development of a trustless FIL lending protocol, which balances the benefits for providers and the costs for borrowers, is imminent under the current context.
### 1.2 What is FILL
FILL is a liquidity pool, which will be implemented on FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine) as a fully open-sourced, decentralized, algorithm-based lending platform. FILL facilitates a market for FIL token holders to deposit for passive interest income, and for SPs to borrow FIL for storage providing.

To distinct from other lending markets, FILL does not require storage providers to collateralize Fiat currencies or other digital assets, instead, the storage providers’ existing account balance and future income would be acting as the collateral. Specifically, by taking over the storage provider’s Beneficiary Address, the potential income from storage mining is pledged by the protocol before the payback. 

The borrowing interest rate is not pre-defined or fixed, but dynamically adjusted naturally by the market condition, i.e., supply and demand. Higher demand in borrowing FIL builds up higher utilization rate for the liquidity pool, which pushes up the borrowing interest rate, while higher amount of FIL deposited into the pool reduces the utilization rate and pulls down the borrowing interest rate.

With the design, entry barrier is significantly lowered not only for the SPs to borrow FIL for power growth, but also for FIL token holders to make deposit, regardless the amount of FIL committed. As a bridge between the token holders as lenders, and storage providers as borrowers, FILL is expected be providing unprecedented liquidity in Filecoin market. It would also contribute the Filecoin ecosystem’s overarching goal of incentivizing a global network of computer operators to provide file sharing and storage services by enhancing the liquidity of FIL and further reducing the cost of storage power growth.
## Design Architecture
The subject of the design is a smart contract that executes transactions on the blockchain automatically. The proposed smart contract is a liquidity pool and a lending market, which calculates interest rate calculations, manages liquidity and provides clearing and settlement. This smart contract mainly interacts with two types of users: 1) lenders, which are usually the holders of the FIL tokens that are ready to earn interest; 2) borrowers, which are the storage providers who are willing to borrow funds to meet the collateral requirement for storage power growth.
